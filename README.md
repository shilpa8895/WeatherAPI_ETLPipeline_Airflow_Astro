# WeatherAPI_ETLPipeline_Airflow_Astro
This project is an ETL pipeline built with Apache Airflow and managed using Astro (Astronomer CLI). It extracts weather data from the [Open-Meteo API](https://api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast?latitude=51.5074&longitude=-0.1278&current_weather=true), transforms it into a structured format, and loads it for downstream usage.
